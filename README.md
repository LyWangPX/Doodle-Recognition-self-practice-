# Doodle-Recognition-self-practice-

It is my schoolwork in MAU and the first swift-based ios app project I have done.

Workflow:

GOOGLE QUICKDRAW DATABASE -> COREML (APPLE) -> SWIFT -> UI -> PENCILKIT -> APP

It's quite time-taking since I have to learn swift first, but I am happy with the result I got.
